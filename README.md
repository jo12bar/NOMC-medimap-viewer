# NOMC-medimap-viewer
Medimap widget viewer + announcement slideshow for the North Okanagan Medical Clinic, running on a Raspberry Pi.

# I'm sorry, what?
My father works as a doctor at the [North Okanagan Medical Clinic](http://www.health-local.com/biz/walk-in-clinics/vernon/british-columbia/north-okanagan-medical-clinic/), and wanted a display running off a Raspberry Pi that could display info from medimap.ca as well as a slideshow for announcements. I decided to run this off a React webapp.

More info will be added as I figure out what I need to do.
