## medimap-viewer-app
This is the actual electron application that does all the display.
- Uses [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) for building (since it was quick and easy).
- Uses techniques from [balena-io/resin-electronjs](https://github.com/balena-io/resin-electronjs) to get Electron working inside of balena.
